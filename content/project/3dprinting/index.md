This project aims to pick up on previous work done by Alexandra Boghosian to 3D print the Greenland ice sheet and bedrock in order to convey the sheer amount of ice in Greenland, shape of the continent, and show ocean terminating glaciers.

Along with Jacob Anderson and Alexandra Boghosian, I aim to recreate the Greenland print at a higher fidelity with an updated pipeline, as well as develop a 3D print for Antarctica.
